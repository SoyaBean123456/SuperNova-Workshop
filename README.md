## What Are Mobile Apps?

A mobile application is a software application designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. 
Users normally use smartphones typically to like check the news, weather, email or their social networks. 
They have a choice between the mobile web version or a specially-created mobile app.

‚óè Hybrid 
      Mix between these two types of mobile applications. 
      Normally based on web programming language, eg: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Dart, React.js
      Built once to be run on Android and iOS. 
      Sometimes very hard to debug

## Benefits Of Supernova.io On How It is Making Life Easier

No more handoffs
    Production-ready code generated in real-time as you prototype so that your app‚Äôs design and code are always in sync. This allows you     to export your final product with the click of a button, eliminating lengthy handoffs entirely.
    No more misplaced pixels
    
    All design elements are backed by native components so that you‚Äôre creating more than a hi-fi prototype -- you‚Äôre building the actual     UI. (Rest assured everything will end up where it needs to be.)
    
No more duplicated work

Development picks up exactly where design left off rather than coding wireframes, animations, and transitions from scratch. Clean, production-ready, and flexible code for iOS, Android, React Native and Flutter.

No more boring, tedious tasks

In a matter of seconds, the creation of layouts, export of assets, localizations, animations, navigation flows and more are crossed off in Supernova.io‚Äôs to-do list.
